# Welcome to RotBoiRemastered! (RBR)
This is a completely Open Source project, do whatever you want with it to your hearts content.

Core components of this game include...
-Absolutely Nothing
-More Nothing
-Literally Nothing





In all seriousness, this game is horribly developed and simply a proof of concepts. There are plenty of inefficiencies, but the point of this program is to show that there
are plenty of oppertunities with simple libraries to build something far greater. There is not much to this program, but if you look around at it you will see that it holds
plenty of oppertunity. Play it a bit and try things out, see how it feels, make it your own. I literally do not care.
